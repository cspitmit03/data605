## 1. Problem Set 1

Netflix assignemnt.

1. Calculate the dot product u.v where u = [0.5; 0.5] and v = [3;-4]
```{r prob1-1}
u = c(0.5,0.5)
v = c(3,-4)
u%*%v

#The answer is -0.5
```
2. What are the lengths of u and v.

```{r prob1-2}
v = c(3,-4)
sqrt(v%*%v)

#The answer is 5.0 for the length of v

u = c(0.5,0.5)
sqrt(u%*%u)

#The answer is 0.707 for the length of u
```

3. What is the linear combination of 3u-2v?

```{r prob1-3}
u = c(0.5,0.5)
v = c(3,-4)
3*u - 2*v

#the answer is vector [-4.5 9.5]
```

4. What is the angle between u and v


cos(theta) = u.v / ||u||*||v||

```{r prob1-4}
dot = u%*%v
magu = sqrt(u%*%u)
magv = sqrt(v%*%v)
costheta = dot / (magu * magv)

acos(costheta)

#the angle is 1.713 radians
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
